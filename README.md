# PCA_Cancer_Data
Principal Component Analysis performed on s cancer to reduce dimentionality and tighter predictions.

Principal component analysis is a technique for dimension reduction — so it combines input variables in a specific way, to drop the “least important” variables while still retaining the most valuable parts of all of the variables! As an added benefit, each of the “new” variables after PCA are all independent of one another. This is a benefit because the assumptions of a linear model require our independent variables to be independent of one another. If we decide to fit a linear regression model with these “new” variables, this assumption will necessarily be satisfied.
The effectiveness of PCA depends upon the scales of the attributes. If attributes have different scales, PCA will pick variable with highest variance rather than picking up attributes based on correlation Changing scales of the variables can change the PCA Interpreting PCA can become challenging due to presence of discrete data Presence of skew in data with long thick tail can impact the effectiveness of the PCA (related to point 1) PCA assumes a linear relationship between attributes. It is ineffective when relationships are non linear.
